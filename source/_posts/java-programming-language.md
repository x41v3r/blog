# 1 About Java

&emsp;&emsp;Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language introduced by SUN (Stanford University Network) in 1995. It not only incorporates the strengths of C++ but also eliminates complex concepts like multiple inheritance and pointers found in C++, making Java both powerful and user-friendly. As a leading example of static object-oriented programming languages, Java excels in implementing object-oriented principles, enabling programmers to tackle complex programming tasks with an elegant approach.

&emsp;&emsp;With the continuous maturation of Java technology in web development, Java has become the preferred development language for web applications.

# 2 Variables and Data Types

## 2.1 Variables

### 2.1.1 Variables in Java

&emsp;&emsp;A variable is a storage area in memory where the data can continuously change within the same type range. It serves as the most fundamental storage unit in a program, consisting of three components: variable type, variable name, and stored value.

&emsp;&emsp;Java defines explicit data types for each kind of data and allocates memory space of varying sizes in memory accordingly. (Java is categorized as a strongly-typed programming language.)

> Variables are used to store data generated during the execution of a program in memory. (We use the variable name to access the data in this memory area.)
