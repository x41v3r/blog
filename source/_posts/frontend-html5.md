# 1 Getting started with HTML

## 1.1 What is HTML?

&emsp;&emsp;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

## 1.2 HTML Element and HTML Tag

&emsp;&emsp;**HTML Element** and **HTML Tags** are related *but distinct*. 

&emsp;&emsp;An HTML element is the complete structure, including the opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (if applicable). On the other hand, A tag is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) that tells the browser what kind of content to expect.
